## 📈 Investment Considerations  
This analysis highlights key **risk factors and investment potential** for Dutch and European banks.  

✅ **Dutch Banks (NN Group, ING, ABN AMRO) Are Highly Correlated**  
- Their stock prices move similarly, limiting **diversification benefits** within the Dutch market.  
- Investing in only Dutch banks may **increase exposure to systemic risk** in the EU.  

✅ **Diversification with Deutsche Bank (Germany) & KBC Group (Belgium)**  
- **Deutsche Bank has lower correlation**, making it a **good hedge** against Dutch market risks.  
- **KBC Group shows higher volatility & returns**, appealing to **growth-focused investors**.  

✅ **Macroeconomic Factors Impacting Dutch Banks**  
- Strong dependence on **EU policies, interest rates, and regulatory changes**.  
- Exposure to **Eurozone economic trends**, making them sensitive to financial crises.  

📌 **Investment Strategy:**  
🔹 **Low-Risk Approach:** Focus on **NN Group & Deutsche Bank** for stability.  
🔹 **High-Risk, High-Return:** Consider **KBC Group & ING Group** for potential growth.  
🔹 **Balanced Portfolio:** Combine Dutch banks with **non-EU financial assets** for risk mitigation.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Improvements  
While this analysis provides valuable insights, **certain limitations exist**:  

✅ **Limited Scope of Risk Metrics**  
- The focus is on **stock price risk**, excluding **profitability, debt levels, or macroeconomic indicators**.  
- Future research should include **Return on Equity (ROE), Non-Performing Loans (NPLs), and Interest Rate Sensitivity**.  

✅ **Model Assumptions & Enhancements**  
- **VaR & Expected Shortfall assume normality**, which may **underestimate extreme risks**.  
- **GARCH captures volatility clustering**, but **external shocks (crises) require additional stress testing**.  
- Future improvements could incorporate **Extreme Value Theory (EVT) or Machine Learning for risk forecasting**.  

✅ **Stress Testing Beyond COVID-19**  
- This project assesses **COVID-19's impact**, but future studies should analyze:  
  - **2008 Global Financial Crisis**, **2022 Inflation Shock**, and **interest rate hikes**.  
  - **EU regulatory changes** and their effect on banking risk.  

📌 **Next Steps:**  
🔹 Expand the dataset to include **more European banks** for broader insights.  
🔹 Implement **alternative risk models** (Monte Carlo simulations, AI-based forecasting).  
🔹 Conduct **multi-scenario stress tests** for different economic conditions.  

This project lays a **strong foundation for banking risk analysis**, but further enhancements can improve accuracy and **inform better investment decisions**. 🚀
